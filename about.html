            Hi, my name is Yufan Zou. I graduated from the University of New
            South Wales in Australia with a bachelor's degree in Computer
            Science. Currently, I am studying Computer Science at Northeastern
            University for my master's degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, I started working as a full-time Back-End software engineer
            at OPPO, which is a top smart device manufacturing company. During
            this experience, I obtained advanced knowledge of Java, like Java
            source code, multithreading, and Spring framework. Besides, I
            participated in building a project from scratch, like system design,
            database design, RESTful API design, writing unit tests,
            optimization, and maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            By thoroughly understanding user requirements and overall system
            architecture, I can deliver products with great performance and an
            easy-to-use experience. I am also happy to learn new technologies
            and incorporate them into my work. Learning and curiosity always
            refresh my mind with better designs and solutions.
          </p>
